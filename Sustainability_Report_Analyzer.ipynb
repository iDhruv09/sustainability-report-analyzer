Permanent workers (G) are on rolls of the Company but do not perform managerial \\nor administrative role.\\n  Note 3: ‘Others’ includes 87 transgender personnel in case of Permanent workers, also included in Permanent employees. Other than Permanent workers include  \\n64 workers overseas without gender bifurcation.\\n  Tata Steel is in the process of expanding its crude steel capacity in India. The phased commissioning of 5 MTPA expansion \\nat Kalinganagar is ongoing and intends to produce 1.7 million tonnes of crude steel in FY2024-25. The contract workforce \\nengaged by the Company is instrumental in timely and cost-efficient project execution, as it provides flexibility and \\nsupplements the skillset of the permanent workforce. By ensuring process efficiency and agile execution, the contract \\nworkforce enables Tata Steel to remain resilient in a dynamic environment.\\n  The Company values their role in its output and achieving its long-term goals. Thus, recognising their contribution to the \\nCompany’s exceptional performance in FY2022-23, Tata Steel – as a pioneering step – gave the employees of its vendor \\npartners, working in the Company’s establishments in India, an ex gratia reward.\\n  The Company acknowledges the importance of building a future-ready culture as a lever to achieve its Strategic Objectives. \\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are recognised as the pillars of the aspired organisational culture. To achieve the goal of  \\na 20% diverse workforce in Tata Steel Limited by 2025, the Company has identified four focus areas for intervention:\\n i) Women\\n   The metals & mining sector, due to its structural bottlenecks, traditionally had a low female participation in its \\nworkforce. Despite best intentions and concerted efforts, progress has been slow due to deeply entrenched \\nstereotypes and a lack of female role models. Tata Steel has consistently worked towards changing the scenario by \\nbreaking the stereotypes and the glass ceiling.\\n » Tata Steel Limited is the first company in India to deploy women in all shifts in mines. The Women@Mines \\nprogramme provides technical training to unskilled women workers and enable them to work in core jobs in mines.\\n » Under the ‘Flames of Change’ initiative, Tata Steel Limited recruited 23 women to create the first-ever crew of \\nfemale firefighters in the steel industry in India.\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n154\\nStatutory Reports'),\n",

In December 2021, Tata Steel Limited became the first \\nIndian company to open core mining operations to the transgender community. \\n » In March 2024, Tata Steel Limited welcomed a new group of 14 transgender employees as Heavy Earth Moving \\nMachinery (HEMM) Operator Trainees in its West Bokaro mining operations. This onboarding initiative marks \\na significant step in the Company’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) journey, increasing the Company’s total \\ntransgender workforce to 100.\\n » The second edition of Queerious — a first-of-its-kind case study competition in India for LGBTQIA+ students — saw \\na 240% surge in registrations over the first edition.\\n iii) Persons with Disabilities\\n   Tata Steel is an equal opportunity employer and has taken several initiatives to ensure inclusive work environment \\nfor differently abled employees.

The Foundation enables its programme SABAL \\nwith the aim of creating a platform for persons with disability through a participative atmosphere and inclusive \\ninfrastructure that enables skilling, employability and financial independence.\\n » In FY2023-24, Tata Steel Limited launched ‘Ananta Quest’, a pioneering case study competition for students with \\ndisabilities. The competition provides participants with opportunities to engage in live internships and potentially \\nsecure job placements at Tata Steel Limited.\\n iv) The Affirmative Action Community (Tribal Community)\\n   The Tata Affirmative Action Programme (TAAP), instituted by the Tata Group in 2007, commits Tata companies to \\nexercising positive discrimination in employing personnel from historically disadvantaged communities. The Tata \\nagenda is aligned with the framework on affirmative action (AA) prepared by the Confederation of Indian Industry \\n(CII), which focuses on the four Es of development: employment, employability, entrepreneurship, and education.\\n » Tata Steel Limited achieved a significant increase in its score band from 650-675 in 2018 to 700-725 in the TAAP \\nAssessment 2023, marking the highest score in the assessment’s history.

The grievance mechanisms are designed based \\non location specific requirements, so as to be most effective.\\nTata Steel Foundation (TSF), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel Limited, is responsible for driving community engagement \\nprocesses in the operational areas of Tata Steel Limited in India. It involves regular interactions with the community, sub-\\ngroups, and local stakeholders to address and resolve grievances. TSF has implemented initiatives in over 5,000 villages across \\nJharkhand and Odisha, impacting over 4 million lives in FY2023-24. It has a team of over 1,400 people working on impact-\\ndriven initiatives that focus on developing tribal and excluded communities with a process of co-creation. These initiatives \\nare change models that can be replicated at regional and national scales. TSF embeds societal perspectives in key business \\nprocesses to create value and long-term social capital.\\nTSF has created a grievance redressal ecosystem that facilitates input from communities in and around Tata Steel Limited’s \\nsites. This ecosystem ensures real-time information flow concerning Tata Steel’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. \\nIt enables issues to emerge before they even reach the grievance stage requiring redressal. The ecosystem consists of  \\nthe following:\\n1.  The contact numbers and names of Unit Heads and Key Personnel are prominently displayed in all TSF offices and in \\nvarious publicly accessible places. This has resulted in the easy and immediate approachability of TSF’s senior leadership \\nto anyone from the community. The TSF leadership team receives regular feedback regarding TSF’s work on the ground, \\nensuring corrective action is taken in advance and concerns are addressed.\\n2.  TSF offices across various regions are accessible to the local communities and stakeholders who frequently visit the team \\nto discuss their issues. In these meetings, community members’ concerns are addressed at length, and their feedback on \\nthe work done by TSF is considered. This feedback is a valuable source of continuous learning that enables the team to \\nidentify lessons and prevent the recurrence of similar grievances in the future. By understanding the dynamic ecosystem \\nwell, the team can adapt and implement initiatives, prioritising them based on the list of addressed gaps.\\n3.  Tata Steel Limited has established forums that involve the participation of community representatives and citizens. These \\nforums are designed to follow a participatory approach rather than a formal grievance redressal system. This approach \\nensures a free flow of input and enables understanding of different perspectives and concerns. Hence, these forums \\nhelp to create a deep two-way relationship between the Company and the communities. Some of the key forums are:\\n a) Scheduled Tribe Stakeholder’s Council\\n b) Scheduled Caste Stakeholder’s Council\\n c) Citizens’ Forum of Jamshedpur\\nTSF deeply engages with communities and Panchayats to implement Tata Steel’s CSR initiatives. This involves continuous \\ninteractions and feedback to the TSF team. Local recruits act as a bridge between the Company and communities, addressing \\ngrievances promptly and comprehensively.\\nTSF teams have an in-built mechanism where the field staff, programme team, and unit heads regularly communicate with \\nindividuals and groups within the communities and other stakeholders. This ensures that any grievances are brought to the \\nattention of senior management. Additionally, the mechanism is supported by regular interactions between the communities \\nand other stakeholders, the thematic and geographic heads of TSF and the TSF leadership team.\\nTSF team members conduct interactive sessions during visits to listen to complaints and provide assistance. They identify \\ncomplaint-prone areas, study them, and implement remedial measures. Outcome monitoring is carried out to ensure timely \\nand strategic grievance redressal.\\nPublic hearings are crucial in obtaining environmental clearance for projects. The Company conducts public hearings \\nregularly to listen to community concerns. Based on feedback, it takes up projects as commitments to address issues raised \\nby stakeholders and communities.\\nSimilarly, Tata Steel has intensified communication with the community in the Netherlands to address concerns among \\nresidents and employees who often live nearby. Employees from neighbourhood towns often receive many questions from \\ntheir community. Tata Steel regularly updates its employees so that they can, in turn, update their respective communities.\\nResidents affected by disturbances from the Company’s operations in IJmuiden can report them to Tata Steel through \\nmultiple channels, including the information desk in Wijk aan Zee, by phone, or by using a complaint form on the Tata Steel \\nNederland’s website. All complaints are investigated. The Company aims to trace the possible source of disturbance promptly \\nand specifically on the premises and take necessary measures as quickly as possible. \\nBased on various data measurements and complaints, processes are improved wherever feasible. For instance, it has been \\nobserved that noise disturbances are primarily associated with incidents such as impacts and collisions, as well as annoying \\nsounds like whistling, humming, and buzzing. To determine possible noise sources, the Company has installed, for example, \\nsound meters on cranes involved in scrap processing. When it comes to measures to reduce noise, it investigates the possibility \\nof building dampers in certain installations.\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n158\\nStatutory Reports'),\n",

STRATEGIC \\nA1.  Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Management\\nRisk Rationale for identifying the risk/\\nopportunity\\nApproach to adapt or mitigate\\nA significant part of Tata Steel’s production \\nis through the blast furnace route, which is \\nan emission intensive process. Tata Steel has \\ncommitted to be Net Zero by 2045 and a \\ntransition to low carbon steelmaking is critical \\nfor the long-term success of the Company.\\nIn India, Tata Steel has adopted multiple strategies to decarbonise its blast furnace \\nroute operations. It has also started building its first Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) based \\ngreen steel plant in Ludhiana, Punjab.\\nIn the UK and the Netherlands, Tata Steel has taken concrete steps to transition to \\ngreen steelmaking.\\nThe detailed strategy to mitigate climate change-related risks is published in its Climate \\nChange Report.

Circular Economy\\nOpportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/\\nopportunity\\nTata Steel’s Initiatives\\nSteel as a material lends itself handsomely \\nto circularity and is recyclable as ferrous \\nscrap to produce new steel. Recycled steel \\nhas a significantly lower carbon footprint, \\nas opposed to producing primary steel by \\nreducing iron ore. Towards the target to be \\nNet Zero by 2045, Tata Steel has increased \\nscrap usage in its steelmaking process.\\nTata Steel produces waste during its \\nsteelmaking process, which can either be \\nreused in its process (and reduce operating \\ncosts) or sold to external parties (e.g., sale \\nof slag to the cement industry), creating \\nadditional revenue for the Company.\\nIn India, Tata Steel has two approaches for value creation from circularity:\\na.  The Industrial By-Products Management Division (IBMD) works to generate \\nvalue from by-products. (For details, please refer to Section C, Principle 6, Essential \\nIndicators, Question 9).\\nb.  The Steel Recycling Business (SRB) is responsible for sourcing and supplying \\nthe entire scrap requirement of Tata Steel in India. Besides supplying processed \\nscrap from its Rohtak (Haryana) plant, it also supplies scrap from various sources \\nacross India. Tata Steel aims to maximise the amount of scrap charged into its \\nexisting blast furnace operations and the upcoming EAF-based green steel \\nplant at Ludhiana, Punjab.\\nIn the Netherlands, Tata Steel plans to increase the percentage of scrap used in \\nsteelmaking from 17% (in 2019) to 30% by 2030. Presently the scrap used is 20%.\\nIn the UK, locally sourced scrap will be key for operating the proposed EAF.\\nFinancial \\nimplications Positive\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n161'),\n",

Water Consumption and Effluent Discharge\\nRisk Rationale for identifying the risk/\\nopportunity\\nApproach to adapt or mitigate\\nTata Steel utilises a large amount of water \\nin its processes and draws it from multiple \\nsources. Tata Steel’s water consumption \\nis regulated in all geographies. Non-\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements \\nregarding effluent discharge and higher \\nwater usage may result in environmental \\ncompensation by regulatory authorities, \\nfinancial loss due to operational stoppage \\nand withdrawal of licence to operate. \\nAs a result of climate change, some \\ngeographies are expected to have \\nreduced access to fresh water, making \\nit a scarce resource. To be cost-efficient, \\nTata Steel must minimise water usage and  \\nmaximise recycling.\\n1.  Addressing water scarcity through the 4R framework of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle \\nand Recover:\\n a.  Reducing fresh water withdrawal to a minimum from rivers by maximising \\nthe recycling of treated waste effluents within the plant through effluent \\ntreatment plants and online continuous effluent analysers.\\n b.  Reusing treated municipal wastewater and water harvesting infrastructure \\nacross multiple locations. In India, Tata Steel aims to achieve ZED (Zero \\nEffluent Discharge) from Works premises and plans to build water  \\nefficient infrastructure.\\n c.  Increased water recovery through an augmentation of the Central Effluent \\nTreatment Plant and sewage treatment plants as well as from storm  \\nrun-off streams.\\n2.  Adopting best available technologies like dry processes to reduce, best practices \\nlike catch pit and pumping infrastructure to recover, central effluent treatment \\nplant with reverse osmosis to treat and recycle effluents in steelmaking \\nprocesses.

Energy Efficiency/Energy Management\\nOpportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/\\nopportunity\\nTata Steel’s Initiatives\\nSteelmaking is a highly energy-intensive \\nprocess. Tata Steel fulfils its energy \\nrequirements through multiple sources: \\ncoal, natural gas, electricity, and other fossil \\nfuels. Energy efficiency and management \\ninitiatives help Tata Steel to manage and \\noptimise energy consumption across its \\noperations, resulting in lower operational \\ncosts, greater resilience in the event of \\nenergy disruptions, and a greater ability to \\nrespond to regulatory obligations. \\nEnergy efficiency and adoption of \\nrenewable energy is also a key lever for \\nTata Steel to lower its Scope 2 greenhouse \\ngas emissions.\\nTata Steel has several initiatives to improve energy efficiency of the Company across \\nall geographies, and already recovers a large part of its process gases to produce \\npower and for heating purposes at all its geographies.\\nTata Steel is also working with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in India to identify and \\nimplement energy efficiency projects across various sites in India.\\nAs a milestone towards achieving Net Zero carbon emissions, Tata Steel has entered \\ninto a definitive agreement with Tata Power to source 379 MW of captive renewable \\npower, which will reduce 50 million tonnes of carbon emissions over the contract \\nperiod of 25 years.\\nTata Steel also commissioned a floating solar power project with a capacity of 10.8 \\nMWp (Megawatt peak) on its upper cooling pond in the plant bringing the total \\ncapacity to 20.34 MWp solar projects in the Jamshedpur plant. The Kalinganagar \\nplant also has a floating solar plant with a capacity of 10.10 MWp.\\nIn the Netherlands, Tata Steel, in alignment with the local ‘Noordzeekanaalgebied’ \\nEnvironmental Agency, has developed an energy savings agenda for 2024-2027, \\nyielding 50+ projects across the site.\\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel Nederland reported 0.63 PJ of energy savings, equivalent \\nto 175 million kWh, or the electricity consumption of over 70,000 households.

In addition, many of the Company’s \\nsteel plants are situated in close proximity \\nof the wider community (e.g., Jamshedpur, \\nIJmuiden, and Port Talbot). Therefore, \\nensuring the safety of its employees, \\ncontract workers, and communities is \\ncritical for continued regulatory and social \\nlicence to operate, especially considering \\nprocess related hazard in a steelwork. \\nIn case safety related processes or \\nperformance of the Company is deemed \\ninadequate, or in case of a significant \\nsafety incident, prohibition order from \\nthe government may also lead to partial \\nclosure of the plant.\\nEach safety incident also has a negative \\nimpact on the health, wellbeing, and \\nmorale of employees along with a negative \\nreputational impact on the Company. They \\nmay also result in operational and financial \\nloss to the Company, including potential \\npartial closure of the plant.\\nTata Steel’s safety and health responsibilities are driven by its commitment to zero \\nharm. The Company has a robust safety management system framework and a sound \\nsafety governance structure.\\nThe Safety Leadership Development Centres (SLDC) in Jamshedpur and IJmuiden \\nare fully operational. These facilities are now being extended to Kalinganagar \\nand Meramandali. These are state-of-the-art facilities dedicated to providing \\ncomprehensive safety training to all individuals entering the workplace and utilises \\ncutting-edge training props and techniques to ensure an engaging and effective \\nlearning experience.\\nIn the Netherlands, to further improve the level of safety on Tata Steel sites, the \\nCompany has taken measures to develop a proactive safety management culture \\nregarding unsafe behaviour. In addition to keeping an eye on incidents (safety \\nissues), it additionally creates more focus on the positive aspects of safety: the \\ncircumstances and moments in which work runs smoothly and safely, to observe \\ncauses and conditions that contribute to safe operations. As a result of this, risks are \\neliminated. The Company pays attention to managing risks and maintaining dialogue \\nregarding healthy and safe working practices.\\nIn the UK, excellence in health and safety is a core value and is felt in everything Tata \\nSteel does and everything it says within the organisation.

Supply chain sustainability\\nRisk Rationale for identifying the risk/\\nopportunity\\nApproach to adapt or mitigate\\nTata Steel has a long and integrated value \\nchain that extends from mining to finished \\nsteel products, with an interconnected \\nnetwork of suppliers, mines, ports, \\nmanufacturing locations, stockyards, \\nwarehouses, processing facilities, channel \\npartners, and customers, handling over \\n100 million tonnes of material in a year. \\nThe production, transportation, storage, \\nand handling of materials like iron ore, \\ncoal, limestone, refractory, aluminium, zinc, \\nferro alloys, etc. have a negative impact on \\nthe environment, including greenhouse \\ngas and other emissions. These materials \\nalso have an adverse impact on the \\nenvironment during their use in iron and \\nsteelmaking.\\nEnvironmentally and socially responsible \\nsupply chain practices safeguard the \\nlong-term viability of the business and \\nsecure a social licence to operate. Reduced \\nScope 3 emission will also have a positive \\nreputational impact and also help achieve \\nthe Net Zero target of the Company.\\n1.  Tata Steel is one of the few companies to measure end-to-end Scope 3 emissions \\nfor all modes of transportation, giving it an equal importance as Scope 1 and \\n2 emissions. The Company has also taken several initiatives to reduce Scope 3 \\nemissions by using cleaner fuel or alternate fuels. Additional details on these \\ninitiatives have been provided later in this report.\\n2.  Tata Steel has also launched the Responsible Supply Chain Policy (RSCP), \\nwhich covers issues related to ethics, human rights, health and safety, \\nand environmental sustainability. The policy is incorporated in the vendor \\nqualification process and all vendors are made aware of and are required \\nto adhere to it. The implementation of RSCP will also help in de-risking the \\nCompany’s supply chain.\\n3.  Tata Steel has launched the Zero Carbon Logistics programme in Europe which \\naims to reduce its CO2 footprint, caused by the transport of its products to the \\ncustomer, by 30% by 2030. Some key initiatives undertaken under the Zero \\nCarbon Logistics programme are as follows:\\n  a.  Tata Steel Nederland is the first steel company in the world to use the \\nGlobal Logistics Emissions Council Framework for emissions reporting, \\nwhich makes different logistics modalities comparable and enables the \\nidentification and improvement of emission hotspots.\\n b.  Optimum Voyage, used for information and optimisation of the most \\nfuel-efficient route for shipping logistics, has resulted in savings of \\napproximately 5% in CO2 emissions.\\n c.  Tata Steel Nederland is working to replace road transport with more \\ncarbon-efficient rail transport, reducing over 5,000 trucks per year.\\n d.  Tata Steel Nederland is working with its value chain partners on \\nalternative and cleaner fuels and is a member of the Sustainable Freight  \\nBuyers Alliance.\\n4.  Tata Steel Nederland has also added Zeremis® Delivered to its service portfolio. \\nThe service offers customers the opportunity to receive their steel through  \\nlow-emission transport to reduce their scope 3 and other emissions associated \\nwith steel transport. Initially, Zeremis® Delivered will be available to customers \\nwithin a driving distance of 300 kilometres from Tata Steel locations in the \\nNetherlands and Belgium. The service will be expanded to further locations \\nin the future.\\n  For more details, please refer to the Social and Relationship Capital section of Tata \\nSteel’s Integrated Report FY2023-24.\\nFinancial \\nimplications Positive \\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n165'),\n",

Since 2019, Tata Steel Nederland has also been a member of the \\nMetal Covenant, an initiative of the Social and Economic Council, where the government, unions, non-governmental \\norganisations, and companies collaborate on the implementation of the OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct \\nand work on improving conditions in the metals value chain.\\n  In the UK, in FY2023-24, Tata Steel had a procurement spent of ~£1.2 billion with approximately 2,500 ‘active’ vendors of \\nwhich 625 vendors, had been qualified or re-qualified through SAP Ariba which includes alignment with the Company’s \\nResponsible Supply Chain Policy. 100% of Tata Steel UK vendors are made aware of the policy during their onboarding \\nprocess. The Company is currently in the process of developing Tata Steel UK Responsible Sourcing & Modern Slavery Policies.\\nb. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?\\n  All suppliers of Tata Steel must declare their commitments to Tata Steel’s sustainability expectations during registration.100% \\nof Tata Steel’s inputs in India are sourced from suppliers who commit to its guiding principles by providing declarations \\nduring the vendor onboarding /registration phase.  \\n  In the UK, 94% of the suppliers have committed to Tata Steel’s RSCP . In the Netherlands, 48% of Tata Steel’s inputs are \\nsourced through suppliers who commit to the guiding principles or equivalent.\\n3.  Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end \\nof life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.\\n  Steel has a very long useful life (typically 25 to 30 years) due to its durability before it needs to be scrapped and recycled. \\nSteel is ideally suited to a circular economy: it is durable and flexible with a long lifespan, provides many opportunities for \\nits reuse and product life extension, is easily recovered and recycled after scrapping due to its magnetic properties, and \\ncan produce new steel using well-proven low-carbon technology. Steel is the only genuinely cradle-to-cradle recycled \\nmaterial, and end-of-life steel, or scrap steel, is not considered a waste product by the steel industry. Instead, it is regarded \\nas an input for steelmaking by remelting and is a globally traded commodity.\\n  Tata Steel is committed to circularity and looks to maximise the use of steel scrap in its operations. Accordingly, Tata Steel \\nreuses scrap generated during the production process as well as procures external scrap. In FY2023-24, Tata Steel recycled \\naround 4.3 million tonnes of scrap (~1.8 million tonnes internal scrap and ~2.5 million tonnes external scrap).\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n178\\nStatutory Reports'),\n",

Tata Steel is in compliance with the regulations.\\nLeadership Indicators\\n1.  Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing \\nindustry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format.\\n  Yes, Tata Steel conducts LCA for most of its products manufactured across various facilities, allowing it to demonstrate \\nthat improvements in material utilisation and right-first-time manufacturing can reduce emissions during the production \\nphase. The Company also plans to collaborate with its customers to conduct a cradle-to-grave LCA study to comprehend \\nthe impact of its products.\\n  Tata Steel UK is widely recognised for its expertise in LCA. By taking a supply chain perspective, the Company demonstrates \\nhow improvements in material utilisation and right-first-time manufacturing can reduce emissions during the production \\nphase. Its LCA models allow it to consider the complete value chain, for instance the impact of the carbon intensity of \\nregional grid electricity (gCO2/kWh) on the carbon footprint of a vehicle or building. To extend its capability in this area, Tata \\nSteel UK developed the PACI (Product Assessment Carbon Indicator) tool. This streamlines the process of undertaking life \\ncycle studies of products and enables an understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission hotspots and trade-offs in the \\nsteel product value chain, which can be used to inform new product developments and optimise existing manufacturing \\nroutes. PACI has been used to support collaborative projects with customers and to support sharing and learning about \\nopportunities for emissions reduction over the product’s life cycle from manufacture through to use and finally end-of-life: \\nfor example, working with an automotive OEM to examine all aspects of materials selection, including material type, steel \\ngrade, gauge, and aspects of formability and part design. Another example has been the use of the tool in understanding \\nthe trade-off between benefits in use from improving motor efficiency versus embodied GHG emissions associated with \\ndifferent grades of electrical steels. The tool was recognised by World Steel Association in 2023, winning a Steelie award \\nfor Excellence in Life Cycle Assessment.\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n179'),\n",

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.\\n  Tata Steel has a strong commitment to sustainable development and has taken several measures to protect and promote \\nhuman rights. Tata Steel has put systems in place to encourage the reporting of concerns related to human rights. In \\naddition to Tata Steel’s own internal processes, employees and suppliers are encouraged to use Tata Steel’s confidential \\nreporting system to report any concerns. The Speak Up platform is available to employees to anonymously raise concerns \\nabout any aspect of Tata Steel’s operations. (https://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/our-organisation/ethics/).\\n  On receipt of any concern through email, letter, web helpline or orally, it is registered by the Ethics Department of Tata Steel. \\nThe investigation team gathers, validates, and analyses the data and provides their observations and recommendations.\\n  The investigation report is further reviewed by the Chief Ethics Counsellor or other appropriate authority and the \\nrecommendations are acted upon. The documentation of the action taken is filed for records. Issues concerning the Key \\nManagerial Personnel’s, Senior Managerial Personnel’s and Chief Ethics Counsellor are addressed to the Chairperson of the \\nAudit Committee of the Company and those concerning other employees are addressed to the Chief Ethics Counsellor of \\nthe Company. The Ethics Counsellor regularly provides an update to the Tata Steel Board’s Audit Committee on the status \\nof various grievance redressal mechanisms.\\n  Tata Steel also obtains declarations from all the value chain partners regarding SA8000:2014 and other ISO requirements. \\nMoreover, all of Tata Steel’s value chain partners have to affirm compliance with the Tata Code of Conduct.\\n  When deemed appropriate, Tata Steel requires suppliers operating in regions recognised as having a higher risk of human \\nrights abuse, including slavery and human trafficking, to adopt suitable and robust policies and procedures to prevent such \\nabuses. It could include having suitable accreditation (e.g., SA 8000:2014). If no suitable accreditation exists, a supplier must \\nprovide evidence that their policies cover the key elements of SA8000:2014, including no forced labour in their operations. \\nAny reported concerns are investigated thoroughly, and appropriate action taken following due process.\\n  No reports were received in respect of modern slavery or human trafficking in the supply chain during FY2023-24. No evidence \\nof such instance has been observed in the value chain during the third-party human rights due diligence assessment.\\n6.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.\\n  Tata Steel encourages its employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to raise concerns or make disclosures \\nwhen they become aware of any actual or potential violation of TCoC, policies or law and accordingly has put in place \\nmechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant, as below:\\n i.  As part of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy (POSH) and Whistle Blower Policy, Tata Steel is committed to the \\nprotection of the identity of the complainant and all such matters are dealt with in strict confidence, with appropriate \\nmeasures taken to maintain such confidentiality.\\n ii.  Under the POSH Policy, aggrieved party may lodge a complaint of sexual harassment against respondent to the \\nchairperson or any member of the relevant Internal Committee (IC). All complaints must be sent in writing and are \\ndealt with in strict confidence by the IC members. After hearing both the parties, the IC thoroughly investigates \\n(including meeting the aggrieved party, examining all evidence, meeting all witnesses, and consulting with experts) \\nand makes a report of its findings for action. The Company also ensures that any employee/stakeholder involved in \\nthe investigations is not victimised or subjected to any unfavourable treatment.\\n iii.  Regular awareness and training sessions are conducted to ensure that the employees/stakeholders are fully aware of \\nvarious aspects of sexual harassment and the redressal mechanism.\\n iv.  Under the Whistle Blower Policy, complete protection is given to whistleblowers against any unfair practice, such as \\nretaliation, threat, or intimidation of termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal \\nof promotion, or the like, including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the whistleblower’s right to \\ncontinue to perform his/her duties and functions, including making further disclosures.\\n v.  The Company take steps to minimise difficulties for the whistleblower because of making the disclosure. Thus, if the \\nwhistleblower is required to give evidence in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Company arranges for the \\nwhistleblower to receive advice about the procedure.\\n vi.  The identity of the whistleblower is kept confidential to the extent possible and permitted under law.\\n vii.  While TCoC discourages retaliation against anyone reporting any legitimate concern, the Whistle Blower policy \\nalso provides for disciplinary action in case the complaint registered is found to be frivolous, false, or made with a \\nmischievous intention.\\n9. Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)\\n  Yes, human rights requirements form part of Tata Steel’s business agreements and contracts. The terms of a contract or \\npurchase order copies submitted to vendors include compliance with SA8000:2014 requirements, and all vendor partners \\nmust comply with such requirements. The SA8000:2014 policy covers various aspects of human rights such as child labour, \\nforced or compulsory labour, health and safety, freedom of association, non-discrimination, disciplinary practices, security \\npractices, working hours, compensation practices, supply chain practices and management systems.\\n  Tata Steel also follows the TCoC globally and expects all business associates and value chain partners to adhere to its \\nprinciples. Specific clauses of the Tata Code of Conduct, including clauses on human rights, are included in all its business \\nagreements and contracts/purchase orders.\\n  The Tata Code of Conduct can be accessed at https://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/our-organisation/ethics/ .  \\nThe Business Associates Code of Conduct can be found at https://www.tatasteel.com/media/9244/business-associates-\\ncode-of-conduct.pdf .\\n  Furthermore, Tata Steel’s Responsible Supply Chain Policy encourages supply chain partners to share the same \\ncommitment. It expects them to integrate the four sustainability principles of Tata Steel (Fair business practices, Health \\nand safety, Human Rights, and Environmental Management) in all their business decision-making, and extend them to \\ntheir own supply chain.\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n203'),\n",

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted \\nby your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the \\npractices adopted to manage such wastes.\\n  Tata Steel believes in the ‘Zero Waste’ philosophy using the 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle) circular economy principles. Tata \\nSteel has collaborated with suppliers and taken up several projects to refurbish equipment under use, improving their life \\nand preventing unnecessary waste. In a first-of-its-kind initiative in India, Tata Steel successfully recycled 12,000 tonnes of \\nused refractories, contributing towards its sustainability goals. Tata Steel also initiated trial runs with its suppliers to switch \\nfrom high-speed diesel to alternate fuels, such as Liquefied Natural Gas, to decarbonise its mining operations.\\n  To minimise the waste produced in the steelmaking process, Tata Steel has a dedicated profit centre for waste management, \\ncalled the Industrial By-Product Management Division (IBMD), to ensure efficient by-product management by adopting \\nadvanced practices for steel waste processing.\\n i)  Reuse & Recycle: Ironmaking and steelmaking slags are the major by-products generated in the steel industry. Other \\nby-products include dust, sludge, mill scales, waste refractories, etc. The by-products are used in various external \\napplications (BF slag in cement manufacturing, metallics in secondary steelmaking, coal tar in coal tar pitch and \\nCarbon Black, and non-metallics of steelmaking slag in civil works, road construction, fly ash bricks) and internal \\napplications (flue dust, lime dust, steelmaking sludge, kiln dust, mill scale and sludge, iron-bearing muck, GCP (Gas \\nCleaning Plant) sludge, LD slag fines, etc., in sinter making, and metallics in steelmaking).\\n ii)  Resource Recovery and Utilisation: Tata Steel has invested in state-of-the-art technologies for processing by-products \\nto maximise value creation. A few of the key facilities are as follows:\\n  a)   Metal Recovery and Steam Ageing Plant: Here, the steelmaking by-product slag undergoes crushing and \\nscreening, followed by magnetic separation that recovers the iron content to be used as a raw material in the \\nsteelmaking process. Non-metallic slag aggregates that undergo weathering at the steam ageing facility are \\nused for civil or road construction. The fines are used as a cementitious material.\\n  b)   Scrap Processing-Storage-Handling Facility: As a significant CO 2 reduction initiative, IBMD collects and \\nprocesses internal scrap to maximise the scrap charge in steel melting shops. It generated a total scrap volume \\nof 1207 KT, comprising 917 KT of steel scrap, which helped reduce the equivalent volume of external scrap buy.\\n  c)   New By-product Value Creation Centre: A state-of-the-art facility equipped with a baling machine, specialised \\ncut-to-length line, and a mechanised processing line for flat product arisings has been set up to deliver customised \\nofferings to external customers. The facility also houses an Innovation Lab to develop light concrete products \\nusing in-house slag aggregates such as Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman.

Granulated BF slag is sold to cement manufacturers, whereas \\nair-cooled slag is processed and utilised in road construction. GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag) was \\nintroduced to create additional value from BF slag, which can be used as a partial replacement for Ordinary \\nPortland Cement (OPC) in concrete production. Tata Steel GGBS is now available under the name ‘Tata Dureco.’\\n iii)  E-Waste Management:  The Company has established a process to ensure effective e-waste management in \\ncompliance with the E-Waste Management (EWM) Rules, 2016. The electronic waste is collected at a central location \\nand managed by the authorised vendor. They are certified to undertake the activities as per the rules and guidelines \\nissued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\\n  While most processed solid waste is reutilised within the manufacturing process, Tata Steel partners with external agencies \\nto dispose of hazardous waste in a secure landfill that is not processed or recycled.\\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\\n211'),\n",
